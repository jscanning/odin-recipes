    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ice cream cake is easy to make with any flavor of ice cream or cake mix you prefer. Frost with your favorite frosting, fudge topping, crushed Oreos, or anything!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package chocolate cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 gallon vanilla or chocolate ice cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in large bowl. Beat until smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, 26 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely on wire rack.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, remove carton paper from ice cream. Set frozen ice cream block on its longest side. Cut ice cream evenly in half length wise, then place both pieces together on sheet of wax paper.</li>
        <li>Remove cooled cake from baking dish and place on top of the ice cream slabs. Trim cake and ice cream as necessary until edges are flush.</li>
        <li>Place a board or serving platter over cake. Holding onto the wax paper and board, flip ice cream cake over so that ice cream layer is now on top. Remove wax paper and smooth seam between the ice cream slabs.</li>
        <li>Cover top with wax paper and freeze until very firm.</li>
        <li>Decorate as desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
